PyBank

Analyzed the financial records of a company, comprising of Date and Profit/Losses

Created a Python script to calculate the following:
  
  - The total number of months included in the dataset
  - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
  - The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes
  - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
  - The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period
  - Exported the analysis to a txt file.  Snapshot below:
